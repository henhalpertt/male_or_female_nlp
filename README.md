Gender Prediction Using NLP
NLP engines nowadays focus mainly on English. Processing Modern Hebrew texts presents serious challenges to standard NLP methods, in turn undermining the capacity to break any new boundaries in DS, BI or AI targeting Hebrew. Hebrew violates a basic assumption concerning the NLP pipeline, namely, the input signal is extremely ambiguous, and words essentially unknown in advance. For example, take an input word “הקפה”; it is unknown whether it is to be processed as the word “orbit”, as the sequence “the coffee”, as “her perimeter”, etc. This extreme ambiguity of the input signal causes a serious performance degradation to any downsteam AI/BI/DS task.

In this project, I will attempt to predict the gender of the person who wrote some text, also known as a story.
Possible outputs:
f - Female writer
m - Male Writer# male_or_female_nlp
